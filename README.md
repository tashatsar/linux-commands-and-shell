### Introduction to Linux
|---|---|
|Linux|Information|
|---|---|
|usage|mobile devices, desktops, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers|
|distros|distributions differ by UIs, shell applications, and how the OS is supported and built. Popular distros: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, Ubuntu, Suse (SLES, SLED, OpenSuse), Fedora, Mint, and Arch.|
|layers|five key layers: the UI, application, OS, kernel, and hardware|
|user interface |enables users to interact with applications|
|application|enable users to perform tasks within the system|
|OS|runs on top of the kernel and is vital for system health and stability|
|kernel|the lowest-level software that enables applications to interact with hardware|
|hardware|includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC|
|shell|OS-level application to send commands via terminal|
|filesystem|tree-like structure consisting of all directories and files on the system|
|text editors|command-line or GUI-based text editors such as GNU nano, vim, vi, and gedit|
|package managers|DEB and RPM packages are used by package managers in Linux operating systems. They are distinct file types containing software or updates for different Linux operating systems.|
|.deb files|used for Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint. Deb stands for Debian.|
|.rpm files|used for Red Hat-based distributions such as CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, and openSUSE. RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager.|
|convert packages|Deb and RPM formats are equivalent, the contents of the file can be used on other types of Linux OSs. TO convert use the `alien` command and specify the package name that you want to convert|
